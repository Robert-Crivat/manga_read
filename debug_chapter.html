                    <p>In the five-star hospital room, Alicia Quinn lay in her bed, alone. The only sounds she could hear was the heartbeat sensor that gave in the monoton beeping echoes every second. In her veins, chemotherapy drugs run freely, she could feel it in her blood. Her once lascivious body reduced to skin and bones. Her lustrous, long blonde hair was no more</p><p>She tried her best to fight the tumor in her breast, yet the best was not enough. She’s aware that her life would be fleeting away at any given moment.</p><p>As an AV superstar and a high-class courtesan, Alicia was renowned as the most scandalous woman in the industry. Not only beautiful, she’s highly intelligent, a master of deceit, and she could prey on high profile individuals through seduction, and bribery. She knows so many secrets in every government's institution. Not all, but enough to make her filthy rich.</p><p>No, she's not just whoring herself for cheap. She acquired assets from every date that she did with famous public figures, every AV that she starred in was riddled with secret messages that would only be recognized by her target. In that way, Alicia made herself untouchable, and controlled her prey’s mind and lust.</p><p>Now that she’s dying from cancer, Alicia could hear the laughter of those people who wished her dead. She was aware that the labels, production house, as well as the higher ups in the AV industry were after her assets.</p><p>However, Alicia was always a hundred steps ahead of everyone. Before they could touch her money, Alicia had listed all of her assets to be auctioned by the bank, and would be transferred into the World Cancer Research Fund directly. Including her secret savings, Alicia gathered around one hundred millions dollars for the charity.</p><p>Her doctors were confident that they could cure her. But, again, there's no telling if the Death would spare her life that easily. Her name was already written in the Book of The Dead.</p><p>Suddenly, an excruciating pain bombarded her nerves. She could feel every inch of her spines burning and had an uncontrollable seizure. The emergency alarm in her room went off, and a team of doctors and nurses rushed in, trying to stabilize her. Fortunately, it only lasted less than a minute. Her heart monitor shows a long flatline on the screen.</p><p>They tried their best to bring her back but to no avail. After a moment of silence, the head doctor of the team soon pronounced her time of death. “Alicia Quinn, Time of death: 6.59 AM. The patient did not respond to resuscitation.”</p><p>Everything went silent in Alicia’s ears. Her sight gradually blacking out, and she could feel something pulling her down, or maybe upward, Alicia had lost her self-orientation.</p><p>‘So, is this what it means to die? It's so… peaceful.” Alicia didn't believe in any particular god, but she was thankful to whomever deities who gave her a painless death. “What a shame… I wish, I could have a nice, big cock in my next life so I could have fun with more hot chicks instead of getting fucked by those middle-aged bastards.”</p><p>Unbeknownst to Alicia, her last wish was heard, and granted by the Goddess of Pleasure, Lilithya. A playful, yet tantalizing smile etched on her face as she pulled Alicia’s soul ever so gently.</p><p>As Alicia regained her sight, she found herself amidst a huge temple made solely from white marble. The high ceilings were adorned with crystal chandeliers, the walls were painted with nude portrayals of both men and women. Porny, almost. Statues stood strong in every corner of the hall, each of them were carved masterfully in bold poses.</p><p>Alicia, as an art aficionado, was amazed by the details of the private parts, even having just recently died, even amidst this strange situation, it somehow turned her on.</p><p>“Where the hell am I?” Alicia finally came back to her senses, muttering under her breath. “It’s definitely not hell or heaven, not with these nude arts.”</p><p>She tried to pinch herself and felt the sting. “Definitely not a dream, or hallucinations. But, I’m certain that I’ve died since I can't feel anymote pain in my spine. Even my hair is back to its normal length.”</p><p>Alicia got on her feet, scanning the humongous hall for an exit. There she found a huge double door adorned with intricate carvings from top to bottom. As she walked towards them, however, she heard a whistling wind behind her.</p><p>She turned to the source of the sound and saw a feminine figure materializing out of the thin air. The dark and light particles swirled around violently, in a matter of seconds, a long, and beautiful leg stepped out chaotic energy.</p><p>Soon, Alicia was utterly bewildered upon witnessing the divine being before her. Her tall, slender build, combined with her flowing black and white attire, contributed to a sense of ethereal beauty and otherworldliness.</p><p>A pair of black and white wings spread wide behind her back. Her long, silver hair flowing down like an eternal waterfall on both sides of her breasts. Her well-defined face, neck, and shoulders were flawless. Her golden eyes gazed at Alicia gently, though her appearance was imposing, Alicia didn't feel frightened or threatened.</p><p>At this moment, Alicia fell in love with the goddess’ beauty.</p><p>“I apologise for my lateness, my dear.” The goddess spoke for the first time. She walked toward Alicia, the way she swung her long legs was breathtaking, every step was so elegant yet arousing at the same time.</p><p>Even just by looking at her stature, her body trembling in excitement, the warmth began to spread from between her thighs. As a high-class courtesan and hostess, gender was not her concern. Oftentimes, she was invited by some rich ladies in the industry to entertain them in their bedrooms. However, it's her first time feeling aroused from looking at a being like her.</p><p>“W-who are you?”</p><p>“Oh, right. Pardon my manners. Name’s Lilithya, Goddess of Pleasure, and you are in my humble temple. Pleased to meet you, Alicia.”</p><p>Alicia’s heart raced so fast when the goddess put a hand on her cheek, she even bit her lower lips, and felt the wetness between her inner thighs.</p><p>‘Oh my…. look at that bombshell body.” Alicia couldn't avert her gaze from the pair of swaying tiddies before her.</p><p>She was quite confident with her height and body shape which was above average for a woman, around six foot tall. Her three measurement was; 120, 80, and 100. Her fans would pay thousands of dollars just to get her personalised nude pictures.</p><p>However, Goddess Lilithya could easily tower over her by ten inches. Alicia was having a hard time choosing which to look at between the Goddess Lilithya’s breast or her face.</p><p>Lilithya chuckled, impressed by Alicia’s tenacity to remain conscious before her presence. “Fufufu, a normal human would go crazy even from looking into my eyes, yet you can stand your ground just fine.”</p><p>“Huh, what did you say?”</p><p>“Oh, nevermind. I’m just mumbling to myself.”</p><p>“My ladyship…?” Alicia muttered, not sure how to address the godly being. “Am I going to hell?”</p><p>“Hell? Mmmm, not quite yet, letting a beautiful soul go to the afterlife would be a wasteful one. Henceforth, I shall give you a second chance to fulfill your deepest desire in your next life.”</p><p>Alicia couldn't wrap her head around it. “A second chance? A sinner like me? Tell it's a joke.”</p><p>Lilithya combed the woman’s hair gently between her long and slender fingers, “you might be a sinner, but not an evil one. Besides, I’m so impressed that you would donate all of your assets to charity. Because of you, breast cancer research has gone through a groundbreaking discovery, millions of women are saved due to your ‘little’ contribution.”</p><p>With just a swipe in the air, Goddess Lilithya summoned a screen which showed the current situation on Earth. And it's already very advanced, perhaps a hundred years later after her death. At this moment, Alicia realized that the temple existed outside time and space.</p><p>“But, please don't feel burdened by my offer though. If you wish to pass unto the afterlife in peace, I would not pursue the matter and send you there right away.”</p><p>“So, I will neither go to hell or heaven? Just straight to the afterlife and lost forever in oblivion?” Alicia raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yes… Death refused to bring you to hell due to your selfless sacrifice. However, the Archangels also refused to ascend your soul to heaven due to your sins. Henceforth… I, Lilithya, Goddess of Pleasure, and also the former Queen of Hell, gave you an offer to live a second life.”</p><p>Alicia pondered for a moment. She’s aware of the concept of reincarnation where a soul is brought back to life and undergoes an endless cycle of death and rebirth until the soul is free from resentment, and ascends to heaven.</p><p>She was also familiar with the Eastern Fantasy pop culture or Japanese anime culture where a random guy got hit by a truck and got isekaid and became a hero. A lot of her clients were also avid fans of these cultures and she was often casted to do cosplay AV.</p><p>“Wait a minute, does this means that I’d reincarnated as your vassal, and you’d give me some quests which forces me to complete them all and be controlled by your script?”</p><p>Goddess Lilithya brushed the woman’s hair. “Fret not my child, Fate, Life and Death is outside my jurisdiction, I’m here to give you the Pleasure that you wanted the most. However, the early days of your second life would be the harshest, be strong, for I will always be on your side.”</p><p>“Alright, so… what kind of person will I be reborn as? A hero, king, queen? Or animals perhaps?”</p><p>Goddess Lilithya smiled gently, she swiped the air once again, and numerous screens appeared from thin air, displaying her next life choices in detail.</p><p>“Why don't you choose it yourself?”</p><p>There were ten choices that she could choose from, starting from reborn as princess whose true identity was an angel and has a reverse harem, to reborn as an evil elf queen whose husband was murdered by humans and sought revenge for eternity until no human were left.</p><p>However, there's one life choice that interests her the most.&nbsp;</p><p>[Reborn as a Demon Queen]</p><p>[Pro: Absolute immunity to any mortal maladies, nearly infinite vitality and stamina, god-level strength, unlimited regeneration.]</p><p>[Cons: Being hunted by the hero’s party.]</p><p>Though she wanted a second life where she could have a big cock, Alicia was too embarrassed to ask for it. She clenched her hand, and pointed at the last choice.</p><p>“Oh? You’ve chosen a life in its hardest difficulty right away, my child. Are you sure?” Lilithya brought Alicia's shoulder closer to her side.</p><p>“I am…” The woman replied firmly. “Besides, the other life choices are too whimsical. And I refused to be controlled by others. I don't mind hardship, as long as I can live under my own rule.”</p><p>“If you say so, I shall grant you the privilege to retain your modern knowledge, and also a Demon Queen System that will help you develop your growth exponentially.”</p><p>“A system? Am I going to get a cheat code that is able to shake heaven and earth?!”</p><p>“Err, don't get your hopes too high just yet though. The Demon Queen System is very powerful, but it would make you… less human every time you used it, and you can't revert the physical and psychological change as you grow older.”</p><p>“What’s the difference? I could barely feel like I lived as a human most of my life, just a tool to satisfy the men who hired me. But, I will be very grateful if you give me some leniency as to grant me a miracle or two.”</p><p>“Wisely said… Here, read it for yourself.”</p><p>Suddenly, the bluish transparent screen appeared before her face.</p><p>[Demon Queen System]</p><p>Name: <span></span>Alice Nightflame</p><p>Class: <span></span>Demon Queen</p><p>Sub Class: Bloodmancer</p><p>Level: 1 (0/1200 EXP]</p><p>Health Points: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100/100 (+5/sec)</p><p>Horny Points:<span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20/20 (+2/sec)</p><p>Stamina Points:<span></span>20/20 (+2/sec)</p><p>Physical Attack: <span></span>4</p><p>Physical Defense:<span></span>1</p><p>Magic Attack:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4</p><p>Magic Defense:<span></span>3</p><p>Speed:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</p><p>[Skills and Ability]</p><p>[Demonic Aura (Active Skill): All living beings are under your feet!

Unfortunately, I can't do anything about it.” The goddess smiled enigmatically.</p><p>“You are talking as if you already know what will happen.”</p><p>“Just glimpses of a fragmented timeline. But in any case, you'll have the best life you ever dreamt of if you manage to push through the early phase. Are you ready?”</p><p>“Mmm!” Alicia nodded firmly. “I am ready!”</p><p>“Very well…” The Goddess blew a wind to Alicia’s face.</p><p>The huge doors opened wide, the void began to suck her out with incredible force. Not even a second, her soul was gone, transferred into a newborn demoness baby.</p><p>****</p><p>The cry of a baby shattered the silence within the Demon’s castle under the light of the full moon. Every species of the demon race in the castle’s premises howled and roared as their future ruler was born after eons of waiting.</p><p>“You have safely delivered the baby, your majesty,” said one of the midwives who helped with the labor.</p><p>In the meantime, Alicia had no control over her body, she cried at the top of her lungs as the midwife cradled her.</p><p>“Let me see my baby, is it a girl or boy?”</p><p>After they wiped the baby clean of blood, mucous, and cut the umbilical cord, the two midwives were shocked upon finding out the baby's gender.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Why are you all making that face?” The demon queen asked, her voice was coarse, almost in whisper.</p><p>“Your baby has both!”</p><p>“How?! It can't be?!”</p><p>At the same time, Alicia looked down between legs, and saw a tiny appendage down below. She screamed and flailed so hard, as her mind couldn't wrap around how she could have a dick.</p><p>‘What the heck!?!’</p>
